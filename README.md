# Offline-messenger
Final project for the Computer Networks course

To develop a client/server application that allows the exchange of messages between users who are connected and offers the functionality of sending messages to offline users as well, the latter showing their messages when they connect to the server. Also, users will have the opportunity to send a response (reply) specifically to certain messages received. The application will also provide the history of conversations for and with each individual user.
